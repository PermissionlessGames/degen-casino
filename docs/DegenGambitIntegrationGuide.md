# The *Degen's Gambit* integration guide

This document describes the player flows on the `DegenGambit` smart contract and breaks down how each
flow can be implemented in terms of the smart contract methods involved. It is meant for people
programming *Degen's Gambit* game clients.

Each flow is described from the point of view of the player.

Flows:

1. [How do I spin?](#how-do-i-spin)
2. How much does it cost to spin?
3. How long do I have to either accept my spin or respin at a discount?
4. What happens if I allow this deadline to elapse?
5. How do I boost a spin?
6. How do I earn GAMBIT tokens?
7. How do I check if I am on a streak?
8. How do I check when I can extend my daily or weekly streak?
9. How do I check the size of the pot?
10. How much can I win?
